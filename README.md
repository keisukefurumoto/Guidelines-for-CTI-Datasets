## This website summarizes detailed information regarding the Guidelines for CTI Datasets included in the following paper [1].

## *Detailed information will be released on this website after publication of the paper [1].

### Background:<br>
The relationship between clients and groups behind cyber attacks has become complicated, making it challenging to deal with cyber attacks.
The use of various types of threat information related to cyber attacks, often referred to as **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**, is necessary.
Therefore, recent trends in the cyber security field are the management and sharing of various types of CTI and the cross-analysis of multiple types of CTI to deal with sophisticated and complex cyber attacks. 

### Purpose of this website:<br>
We provide the necessary information for constructing **well-balanced datasets** required for CTI research.
Our paper [1] showed that existing CTI research uses unbalanced datasets. We used the following datasets and their statistical information (IoC).

1. Datasets<br>
   -Security Reports(17 vendors)<br>
   -Public Databases(NVD, ExploitDB)<br>
   -Dark Web Datasets(Market and Forum Sites)<br>
2. statistical information (IoC)<br>
   -IPv4<br>
   -FQDN<br>
   -Email<br>
   -URL<br>
   -File name<br>
   -Hash<br>
   -CVE<br>

### Availability of our dataset
Due to the inclusion of proprietary and potentially copyright-protected content (e.g., vendor reports), we must carefully manage access to the dataset and cannot release it publicly in its entirety. However, portions of the dataset will be made available to academic researchers who enter into a research agreement or Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with our institution. Eligible recipients generally include researchers affiliated with universities or public research organizations (e.g., those with institutional email addresses). This controlled sharing policy is designed to balance the need for research transparency with compliance to legal and ethical obligations, such as copyright restrictions and vendor terms of service.<br>

- If you are a student, please ask your supervisor to email us. <br>
- If you are a faculty member, please send us the email from your university's email account.<br>
- Please include your name and affiliation in your email. <br>
- The information is needed for verification purposes. <br>
- *Your request may be ignored if we cannot determine your identity or affiliation.<br>
